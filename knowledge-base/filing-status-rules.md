## Five Filing Statuses

- Combines all income, deductions, and credits
- Generally results in lowest tax for married couples
- Both spouses jointly liable for the entire tax

### 3. Married Filing Separately (MFS)
- Married but choose to file separate returns
- May benefit if: one spouse has large medical expenses, student loan issues, or income-driven repayment plans
- Disadvantages: lose many credits (EITC, education credits), lower IRA deduction limits
- SALT deduction cap: $5,000 (vs $10,000 for MFJ)
- Standard deduction: $15,000 (same as Single)

### 4. Head of Household (HoH)
**Requirements (must meet ALL):**

- Paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home
- A qualifying person lived with you for more than half the year

**Qualifying persons:**
- Your child, stepchild, adopted child, foster child (under 19, or under 24 if student)
- Your parent (does not need to live with you, but you must pay >50% of their housing costs)
- Other qualifying relative who lived with you

**Benefits over Single:**
- Higher standard deduction ($22,500 vs $15,000)
- Wider tax brackets (10% bracket up to $17,000 vs $11,925)
- Typical savings: $1,200 - $2,500 depending on income

### 5. Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS)
- Spouse died in 2023 or 2024
- You have a dependent child
- You paid >50% of home costs
- You did not remarry
- Can use this status for 2 years after death
- Gets same brackets and standard deduction as MFJ

## "Considered Unmarried" Rule

You're "considered unmarried" for Head of Household if ALL are true:
1. You file a separate return
2. You paid >50% of home costs
3. Your spouse did not live in home for last 6 months of year
4. Your home was main home of your child for >6 months
5. You can claim the child as a dependent

## Filing Status Decision Tree

```
Are you married on Dec 31?
├─ YES → Do you want to file jointly?
│        ├─ YES → Married Filing Jointly ✓
│        └─ NO → Married Filing Separately
│                 (Check "considered unmarried" for HoH)
└─ NO → Do you have a qualifying dependent?
         ├─ YES → Did you pay >50% of home costs?
         │        ├─ YES → Head of Household ✓
         │        └─ NO → Single
         └─ NO → Did spouse die in 2023/2024?
                  ├─ YES + dependent → Qualifying Surviving Spouse ✓
                  └─ NO → Single
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Filing Single when HoH applies** — Most common error; costs taxpayers $1,000+
2. **Claiming HoH without qualifying person** — Child must live with you >6 months
3. **Not knowing about QSS** — Many widows/widowers miss this status
4. **MFS when MFJ is better** — Usually MFJ saves more; compare both
