## Key Considerations for Filers

1. **SALT Deduction Cap**: $10,000 federal cap on state/local tax deduction
2. **Reciprocity Agreements**: Some bordering states don't tax commuters
3. **Remote Work**: Generally taxed in state where work is performed
4. **Military**: Taxed in state of legal residence, not station
5. **Part-Year Residents**: Prorate income by days in each state
