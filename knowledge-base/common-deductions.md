## Decision Framework

1. Add up all itemized deductions
2. Compare to standard deduction for filing status
3. If itemized > standard → itemize (file Schedule A)
4. If standard > itemized → take standard deduction (simpler, no Schedule A)

## Red Flags for Audit

- Charitable donations exceeding 30% of income
- Home office deduction for W-2 employees (generally not allowed post-TCJA)
- Medical expenses that seem disproportionate to income
- Business losses claimed year after year
