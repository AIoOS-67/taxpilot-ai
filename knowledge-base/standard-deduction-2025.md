Source: IRS Revenue Procedure 2024-40, Publication 501

## Base Standard Deduction

| Filing Status | Amount |
|---|---|
| Single | $15,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $30,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $15,000 |
| Head of Household | $22,500 |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse | $30,000 |

## Additional Standard Deduction (Age 65+ or Blind)

| Filing Status | Per qualifying condition |
|---|---|
| Single or Head of Household | $2,000 |
| Married (Filing Jointly or Separately) | $1,600 |

Example: A single filer age 66 gets $15,000 + $2,000 = $17,000.
A married couple both over 65 filing jointly: $30,000 + $1,600 + $1,600 = $33,200.

## Who Cannot Use Standard Deduction

- Married Filing Separately when spouse itemizes
- Nonresident aliens
- Tax year less than 12 months (certain fiscal-year changes)
- Estates and trusts

## Standard vs. Itemized Decision

Take the **larger** of:
1. Standard deduction for your filing status, OR
2. Total of all itemized deductions (Schedule A)

Most filers (~87%) benefit from the standard deduction.
